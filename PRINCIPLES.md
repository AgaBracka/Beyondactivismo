# Our principles

This three principles are our basis for achieving a project that is sustainable over time and that allows us to help contribute to a free and secure Internet for all those who want to be part of it.

__a) Openness__  

Our goal is to build a worldwide community that joins us in the task of making the stories of activist visible.

As an open  project we implement tools and principles that make collaboration easy and rewarding.


- create and share content  
_to facilitate the production of content we are creating tools and templates to ease and standardize workflows in a privacy by default multilingual platform._

- translate our content to multiple languages  
_Our content as well as our community building effort targets non-english speaking people, too. That's why offering our platform in multiple languages is crucial to us_

- promote the re-utilization and remix of content:  
_BA works with Licenses that allow anyone to share and adapt our content (CC BY 4.0 for content/ MIT for code)_

__c) Digital Inclusion:__  
Beyond Activismo is a platform that promotes diversity and respect. We strongly believe that only by bringing different perspectives and experiences we'll be able to achieve our goals. To create a safe and accessible collaboration platform is at the core of our development.  

__b) Decentralization:__  
Our project is thought as a global community of passionate Internet users who share our vision.  They can work in our platform where we are going to use open standards to facilitate the interoperability.
