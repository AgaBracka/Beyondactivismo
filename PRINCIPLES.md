# Principles from Beyond Activismo

This three principles are our basis for achieving a project that is sustainable over time and that allows us to help contribute to a free and secure Internet for all those who want to be part of it.

a) Opennes: Our project is thought as a open network of collaborators where they can work, give ideas, make improvements, take decisions, and so on. 
That is why we are working with open repositories where among other things our community can:

- promote ideas, projects, activist to interview, etc.  
- design and improvement of our website
- create, improve and distribute content (for example, submitt written interviews, documentary films, photographys, animations, etc) 
- create, improve and use toolkits (to facilitate the production of content about human rights activists, we are creating tools and templates to ease and standardize workflows in a safe multilingual platform, because we believe that using the internet to create a safe and healthy space, we can break different physical and non physical borders to allow everyone to benefit from this project)
- translate the content uploade by the community
- promote the re-utilization of content (BA works with Licenses where the only restriction is the recognition of authorship of the works)

b) Decentralization: Our project is thought as a global community of passionate Internet users who share our vision. They can work in our platform where we are going to use open standards to facilitate the interoperability. 

c) Digital Inclusion: We believe in a place where everybody can participate without threats to our or others reputation, confidence, or safety. Beyond Activismo is aim to be a platform where we promote and expect diversity and respect. If we could achieve to everyone is because we are achieving our goal.
