Trying to understand people from different cultures, religions and countries have in common through their activism, is an amazing but difficult task.
With that in mind, we are working on an open project that tries
to connect and share the histories & experiences of human rights activists, in an attractive and creative way.

# Welcome


Hi! Welcome to Beyond Activismo!
Thank you very much  for visiting us, we are very happy to share information about the project, and also to have the possibility of inviting you to be part of this community.

### What are we doing
About Beyond Activismo

We are addressing the following problems:

1. When human rights topics are discussed in the news, often activists lack attention. Even if their struggles get worldwide attention, _they_ often
are unknown, their motives, strategies and experiences are lost.
2. Human rights activists around the world don’t have an easy tool for connecting with each other, and it is important that they can share their
experiences to empower others.
3. Collecting and distributing information is too big a task for only a couple of people.

### What is our solution?
With those problems as a starting point, we came up with an idea for a safe multilingual platform, that works as an open collaboration network between different people around the world. 

Here, on the one hand we can share verified human rights
activist’s experiences and histories in an attractive and creative way, documented by the BA Community. 

On the other hand, human rights activists can inspire, interact, collaborate and support each other.

### How do we plan to achieve this?

We are building a community of collaborators with different skills to help us to document and share the experiences and histories of human rights activists, in an attractive and creative way.

We are also working on a multilingual platform where we can share the content created by the BA Community. We believe that by using the internet to create a safe and healthy space, we can break different physical and non-physical borders to allow everyone to benefit from this project.

To facilitate the production of content about human rights activists, we are creating tools and templates to ease and standardize workflows.
