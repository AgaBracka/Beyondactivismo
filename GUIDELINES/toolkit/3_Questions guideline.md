Scheme of questions for the interviews to Beyond Activismo:

**1.Find a History **

   everything upto the day of the meeting 
  
  - conctact the person: present the project, and the reason why you believe it is important to publish hers/his history.
  - Basic tips on how to approach people. Waiting time before re-writing to somebody.
  
   
**2.Setting**

_(People who does not have previous expiriencess.)_
_(see if we can do it in an interactive/merge way for different ‘levels’ of experience, E.g BBC cooking manual)_

E.g [from Lay out and organization](https://www.circulardesignguide.com/post/embed-feedback)
_(Buletpoint with basic introduction and at the end of each one we can add a Link with extra material) 


* Setting: take into account the place and how the person will feel. If possible always do it on a place the person proposed. Also take on account your surroundings(noise or wind when recording audio, light for shooting video)

* Attitude/ Behavior : be calm and friendly. Respect the time of others. It is not an interview to confront somebody but to understand and lend a voice to them.

* Technical setting of micro, camera, etc

This scheme works as a guideline and support for all our collaborators to understand BA purpose.
