E.g [Of organization](https://www.circulardesignguide.com/post/embed-feedback)



**Attitude/ Behavior:** be calm and friendly. Respect the time of others. It is not an interview to confront somebody but to understand and lend a voice to them.

**Technical setting:**

   * micro: -What about ambient noise levels? Traffic/machine noise/wind?
-is it a controlled or uncontrolled environment? 
   * camera:   
      * check white balance, settings, iris etc.
        * follow composition guidelines (rule of thirds, headroom, looking space, etc) 
        * no 'crossing the line'  - imagine the camera is a theatre audience, your subjects are on stage – the camera should stay in the audience and not cross to the other side of the speakers.
        * camera at eye level (or maybe slightly above) 
        * subject should look at interviewer, just off camera 


                                 Before starting double check everything!!!
