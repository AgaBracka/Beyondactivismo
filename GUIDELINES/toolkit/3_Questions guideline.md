* Setting: take into account the place and how the person will feel. If possible always do it on a place the person proposed. Also take on account your surroundings(noise or wind when recording audio, light for shooting video)

* Attitude/ Behavior : be calm and friendly. Respect the time of others. It is not an interview to confront somebody but to understand and lend a voice to them.

** Technical setting of micro, camera, etc
This scheme works as a guideline and support for all our collaborators to understand BA purpose.
