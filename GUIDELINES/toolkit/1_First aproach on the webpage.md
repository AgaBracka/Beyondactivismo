# First Aproach 
First of all we want to give the conrtibutor a placent aproach to our project.  
The idea is to eassey the getting in touch with our principales and goals. 
This would be part of the webpage, and the content could also work as precentation material for reaching potential Histories or contributors. 

Therefore we´d like to develope a **Set of videos/animations:** 


* [BA pitch](https://github.com/Beyondactivismo/Beyondactivismo/issues/20)


* BA´s owns definitions
  * Activism
  * Human rights
  * Open Source

* Technical knowledge
  * Link tutorials on software we recomend to be used:
    * Audacity
    * Opencut
    + gimp
    + Tools for working open(Github, Etherpad)


                           After these videos we can put a big downloading box for the TOOLKIT.
