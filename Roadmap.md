_Beyond Activismo is a safe multilingual platform, that works as an open
collaborator network between different people around the world, where on the one
hand we can share, in an attractive and creative way, verified human rights 
activists experiences and histories documented by the BAâ€™s Community. 
And on the other hand, where human rights activists can inspire, interact, collaborate and support each other._
